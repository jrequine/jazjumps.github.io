      <category>Goals</category>
      <description>DJ knows his job. My job is to put us in the right position for success. Here's what we're working on heading into the 2026 season—flatwork, adjustability, grids, and more.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        <p>With January just around the corner, I've been thinking a lot about our training approach for the 2026 season. Here's the thing about DJ: he knows his job. He's competed at high levels, won six bars at 1.60m, and has more experience over fences than I could ever dream of.</p>
        <p>My job isn't to teach him how to jump—it's to put us in the right position for him to do what he does best. That's what we're working on: flatwork and rhythm, adjustability, grids and gymnastics, turns and lines, and my own mental preparation.</p>

        <p>I genuinely don't know where to begin. Eighteen days ago, I finally took the plunge and joined TikTok after years of avoiding social media. I had no idea what to expect, no strategy, no plan—just a camera, my horse DJ, and a willingness to share our journey. What has happened since has been nothing short of incredible.</p>
        <p>In just 18 days: 5,000+ followers, 250,000+ views, 23,000+ likes. These numbers are beyond anything I could have imagined when I posted that first nervous video.</p>

        <p>One of the things I'm most proud of—besides DJ, of course—is building JET (Jasmine's Equine Transport) into a trusted transport service. Today I want to tell you the story behind the business and, more importantly, the horsebox that makes it all possible.</p>
        <p>Transport has always been part of my life in horses. Growing up around Newmarket and working at some of the finest racing yards and studs in the area, I've clocked up over 450,000 miles transporting horses of all kinds.</p>

        <p>The Voltaire Blue Infinite isn't just a saddle—it's a smart saddle. Built on Voltaire Design's reputation for exceptional craftsmanship, the Blue Infinite takes things further by incorporating technology that tracks and analyses your riding in real-time.</p>

        <p>December's show at Suffolk Equestrian might seem like just another local unaffiliated competition, but for us it's much more than that. It's the first step in what's going to be a demanding 2026 season.</p>
