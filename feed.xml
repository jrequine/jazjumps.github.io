        <p>One of the things I'm most proud of—besides DJ, of course—is building JET (Jasmine's Equine Transport) into a trusted transport service. Today I want to tell you the story behind the business and, more importantly, the horsebox that makes it all possible.</p>
        <p>Transport has always been part of my life in horses. Growing up around Newmarket and working at some of the finest racing yards and studs in the area, I've clocked up over 450,000 miles transporting horses of all kinds.</p>

        <p>The Voltaire Blue Infinite isn't just a saddle—it's a smart saddle. Built on Voltaire Design's reputation for exceptional craftsmanship, the Blue Infinite takes things further by incorporating technology that tracks and analyses your riding in real-time.</p>

        <p>With the Suffolk Equestrian Christmas Show Jumping just around the corner, the focus right now is all about getting DJ back into competition shape. After a quieter autumn, it's time to ramp things up and start building towards our spring goals.</p>
        <p>December's show at Suffolk Equestrian might seem like just another local unaffiliated competition, but for us it's much more than that. It's the first step in what's going to be a demanding 2026 season.</p>

      <description>After much planning, preparation, and more than a few pinch-me moments, I'm thrilled to share that competing at the Andalucia Sunshine Tour in Spain is my primary focus for 2026. This has been a dream of mine for years, and it's finally becoming a reality.</description>
