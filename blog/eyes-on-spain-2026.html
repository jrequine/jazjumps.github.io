                <p>After much planning, preparation, and more than a few pinch-me moments, I'm thrilled to share that competing at the Andalucia Sunshine Tour in Spain is my primary focus for 2026. This has been a dream of mine for years, and it's finally becoming a reality.</p>

                <div class="post-image">
                    <img src="../images/sunshine-tour.png" alt="Andalucia Sunshine Tour">
                </div>

                <h2>The Andalucia Sunshine Tour</h2>
                <p>For those who don't know, the <a href="https://www.sunshinetour.net/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andalucia Sunshine Tour</a> is one of Europe's most prestigious show jumping circuits, held in Vejer de la Frontera in southern Spain. It attracts top riders from around the world, and the facilities and atmosphere are simply world-class. In March 2026, DJ and I will be there competing at 1.00m, 1.10m, and 1.25m classes.</p>
                <p>This isn't just about one competition though. It's about testing ourselves on the international stage, gaining experience against some of the best combinations in Europe, and seeing where we stand. The experience will be invaluable for both of us.</p>

                <h2>Building Towards Spain</h2>
                <p>We're not going in cold. In December, we'll be competing at the <a href="december-show-prep.html">Suffolk Equestrian Christmas Show Jumping</a> at 1.00m and 1.10m—a perfect warm-up to keep us sharp over the winter months. These unaffiliated competitions are brilliant for keeping DJ fit and focused without the pressure of graded classes.</p>
                <p>Then comes Spain in March, followed by the Royal Norfolk Show in June where we'll be defending the 2025 title at 1.25m (won by Jake Hall on DJ last year). The goal is a consistent, progressive season that builds on each competition.</p>

                <h2>Balancing Competition and Business</h2>
                <p>Of course, pursuing competition goals doesn't mean stepping back from <a href="../transport.html">JET (Jasmine's Equine Transport)</a>. The transport business continues to be an important part of what I do, and I've built it specifically to work alongside my competition schedule. Many of my clients are fellow competitors who understand the demands of the sport, and we support each other.</p>
                <p>If anything, competing at this level makes me a better transporter. I understand firsthand how important it is for horses to arrive at competitions calm, comfortable, and ready to perform. Every detail matters.</p>

                <h2>Thank You</h2>
                <p>To everyone who has supported me on this journey—whether you've followed along on TikTok, trusted me with your horse transport, or simply sent an encouraging message—thank you. The response since joining social media has been overwhelming, and it means so much to know that people are invested in this journey.</p>
                <p>2026 is going to be a big year. I can't wait to share it with you all.</p>
