                <p>One of the things I'm most proud of—besides DJ, of course—is building <a href="../transport.html">JET (Jasmine's Equine Transport)</a> into a trusted transport service. Today I want to tell you the story behind the business and, more importantly, the horsebox that makes it all possible.</p>

                <h2>Why I Started JET</h2>
                <p>Transport has always been part of my life in horses. Growing up around Newmarket and working at some of the finest racing yards and studs in the area, I've clocked up over 450,000 miles transporting horses of all kinds—thoroughbreds heading to race meetings, breeding stock going for coverings, and competition horses travelling to shows.</p>
                <p>After seeing first hand the stress horses can experience during transport, I realised just how much the journey affects performance. A stressed horse that's been bouncing around in a poorly designed box doesn't arrive ready to compete. A calm, comfortable horse that's travelled well? That's a horse ready to do their job.</p>
                <p>JET was born from that understanding. I wanted to offer the kind of transport service I'd want for my own horse—professional, caring, and with every detail considered.</p>

                <h2>Choosing Broomfields</h2>
                <p>When it came to selecting a horsebox, there was really only one choice: <a href="https://www.broomfieldshorseboxes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broomfields</a>. They're renowned in the equestrian world for their exceptional craftsmanship and attention to detail. Every horsebox is purpose-built with the horse's comfort and safety as the priority.</p>

                <div class="post-image">
                    <img src="../images/horseboxdiagram.png" alt="Broomfields Horsebox Layout">
                </div>

                <p>What sold me was the quality of the build. The partitions, the flooring, the ventilation—everything is designed with decades of experience behind it. Broomfields understand that horses need space to balance, good airflow to stay calm, and a quiet ride to arrive relaxed.</p>

                <h2>The Details That Matter</h2>
                <p>It's the little things that make a Broomfields box special:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rubber flooring</strong> that provides grip and cushioning for the horses' legs</li>
                    <li><strong>Excellent ventilation</strong> to keep horses cool and calm during travel</li>
                    <li><strong>Thoughtful partition design</strong> that gives horses room to balance naturally</li>
                    <li><strong>Quiet, smooth ride</strong> that minimises stress on longer journeys</li>
                    <li><strong>Attention to weight distribution</strong> for stability on the road</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These aren't just nice-to-haves—they're essential for any horse, but especially for competition horses who need to arrive in peak condition, or mares with foals at foot who need extra care.</p>

                <h2>From Racing to Show Jumping</h2>
                <p>My background in racing transport taught me what thoroughbreds need—these are sensitive, athletic horses that demand the best. That same standard applies to everything I do now with JET, whether I'm taking DJ to the <a href="december-show-prep.html">Suffolk Equestrian Christmas Show</a>, transporting a mare and foal to a stud, or heading to Tattersalls for the sales.</p>
                <p>The breeding work is a big part of what I do. I specialise in transporting mares to be covered along with their foals at foot, and I offer planned seasonal contracts for studs who need a reliable primary transport provider throughout the breeding season. There's nothing quite like the responsibility of carrying a mare in foal or a valuable foal at foot—it requires patience, experience, and the right equipment.</p>

                <h2>Competition Transport</h2>
                <p>For fellow competitors, I understand exactly what you need. When I'm transporting show jumpers to competitions, I'm not just thinking about getting from A to B—I'm thinking about how that horse needs to arrive. Calm, settled, and ready to perform.</p>
                <p>With the <a href="eyes-on-spain-2026.html">Andalucia Sunshine Tour</a> on the horizon for DJ and me, I know just how important it is to arrive at a venue with a horse that's relaxed and focused. Every detail of the journey matters, from the timing to the temperature to the rest stops.</p>

                <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
                <p>If you're looking for professional horse transport in the Newmarket, Suffolk, or Cambridgeshire area—or anywhere across England—I'd love to help. Whether it's a one-off journey or a regular arrangement, every horse gets the same level of care.</p>
                <p>Head over to the <a href="../transport.html#contact-transport">transport page</a> to get a quote, or drop me an email at hello@jazjumps.com. I'm always happy to discuss your requirements and find the best solution for you and your horse.</p>
