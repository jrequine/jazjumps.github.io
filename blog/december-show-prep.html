                <p>With the <a href="https://www.myridinglife.com/eventdetails.aspx?id=528370" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suffolk Equestrian Christmas Show Jumping</a> just around the corner, the focus right now is all about getting DJ back into competition shape. After a quieter autumn, it's time to ramp things up and start building towards our spring goals.</p>

                <h2>Why This Show Matters</h2>
                <p>December's show at Suffolk Equestrian might seem like just another local unaffiliated competition, but for us it's much more than that. It's the first step in what's going to be a demanding 2026 season. We'll be competing at 1.00m and 1.10m—nothing too ambitious, but enough to get DJ thinking, moving, and back into the rhythm of competition.</p>
                <p>There's no substitute for actually getting out there and competing. You can train at home all you like, but the atmosphere of a show—the sights, sounds, and energy—is something you can only replicate by doing it. DJ knows his job, but after some time off, it's about reminding him what we're here to do.</p>

                <h2>Building Fitness for Spring</h2>
                <p>The real goal here is building DJ's fitness and sharpness heading into the spring. With the <a href="eyes-on-spain-2026.html">Andalucia Sunshine Tour in March</a>, we need to arrive in Spain with a horse that's fit, confident, and competition-ready. That doesn't happen overnight—it's built through consistent work over the winter months.</p>
                <p>Our training right now is focused on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cardiovascular fitness through varied flatwork and hacking</li>
                    <li>Gymnastic exercises to keep him supple and adjustable</li>
                    <li>Low-key jumping sessions to maintain his technique without overdoing it</li>
                    <li>Plenty of variety to keep him mentally fresh</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It's a balance between doing enough to build fitness and not doing so much that we peak too early or risk injury.</p>

                    <img src="../images/984809F9-107A-46A7-8CCD-4AAC3A6624C2_1_105_c.jpeg" alt="DJ in the arena">
                </div>

                <h2>More Local Shows to Come</h2>
                <p>The December show won't be our only outing before Spain. I'll be adding more local UK shows to the calendar over the coming weeks—nothing too far from home, just opportunities to keep DJ ticking over and gain more ring time together. Unaffiliated shows are perfect for this: relaxed atmosphere, good experience, and no pressure.</p>
                <p>Keep an eye on the <a href="../index.html#events">Events section</a> on the homepage—I'll update it as soon as new dates are confirmed.</p>

                <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
                <p>Everything we're doing right now is about building towards the spring. The Sunshine Tour in March, the Royal Norfolk Show in June, and everything in between. Having the right equipment helps too—my <a href="voltaire-blue-infinite.html">Voltaire Blue Infinite saddle</a> gives me data on every training session so I can track our progress. It's exciting to have such clear goals to work towards, and DJ has no idea what adventures await him!</p>
                <p>For now though, one step at a time. First up: December in Suffolk. Let's get this season started.</p>
